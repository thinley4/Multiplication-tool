# Multiple tools

Here I have demonstrated the use of multiple custom tools for calculation using LangGraph and Google's Gemini AI model through natural language queries.

By referencing this code, users can build full-featured applications that integrate various tools such as web search, weather APIs, code execution, and other essential tools to address areas where LLMs may provide incorrect answers or hallucinate. Most importantly, since LLMs are not updated with recent news or events, these tools help solve information gaps and provide accurate, real-time data.
